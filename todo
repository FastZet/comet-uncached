2.0
- If max uncached specified keeps only the ones with most seeders
- Option to show Seeders in the title (Seeders are always shown for uncached results)
- Refactored logic to add uncached files into a more general function
- Added Sorting, ["Sort_by_Rank" (Default), "Sort_by_Resolution", "Sort_by_Resolution_then_Seeders", "Sort_by_Resolution_then_Size"]
- Added language Preferences

Still need to do:
- Check other indexer, what if a magneturi is provided and a link for private indexers?
- Check FileResponse, cause not working on localhost (Seems like vlc/stremio app cant handel fileresponse as it causes multiple redirects, works in stremio browser tho)
- Check if works with zilean and torrentio
- Check prowlarr, as some private trackers on prowlarr return no infoHash, even tho Jackett does
- Check Language Prioritization especially with sort by rank (is kinda sus)
