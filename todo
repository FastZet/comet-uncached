- Added Sorting of Results by Resolution + WebUi
- Added a Max Uncached Option to limit those results + WebUi
- Added a WebUi for which indexers to consider for uncached results
- Added Validation for selected uncached indexers
- Added Uncached Warning to title (Only for the selected indexers)
- Modified Real Debrid to handle uncached files
	- Added DB Table to cache uncached files + cleanup

Still need to do:
- Check other indexer, what if a magneturi is provided and a link for private indexers?
- Check FileResponse, cause not working on localhost
- Check if works with zilean and torrentio
- Check prowlarr, as some private trackers on prowlarr return no infoHash, even tho Jackett does
